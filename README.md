Yes, enyo already has [onyx][1], but over time I have grown to love Bootstrap.
It evangelizes a clean intuitive dom structure, comes with some great default
styles that are easy to theme in any way you please, and is a great start for
many websites.  Probably best of all I already know and understand bootstrap and
found myself wishing I could just easily use enyo to throw some bootstrap
components in my enyo application.

Rather than just sit around I decided to just implement it myself, and thus I
started this project.  That being said if you would like to contribute, I
welcome the help.  One of the things that has made Bootstrap so great is the
combined effort of hundreds of contributors.  It would be great to have an
alternative UI framework for enyo that was as reliable, themable, and as
extensible as Bootstrap.

These two frameworks actually mesh together really well. Enyo and Bootstrap both
use less as their CSS pre-processor.  And Enyo is extreemly flexible and powerfull,
and yet you can still work very close to the dom.  Enyo is more than capable of
replicating all of bootstraps functionality in an easy to understand way.

Where I see this project really being valuable is where Enyo really shines, on mobile.
If you are building a web application for mobile, either as a mobile website or
as a phonegap application you want to use enyo to implement a Bootstrap based UI
you have found the right project.
